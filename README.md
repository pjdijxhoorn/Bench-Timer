# Coach Helper

View the live project here. [link](https://pjdijxhoorn.github.io/milestone-project-2/)

This is a website to help Fieldhockey coaches solve real life problems. I am a field hockey coach myself,
and a problem that my colleagues and I kept running in to is the subbing(switching) of players and how to
keep this as fair as possible. This website is designed to solve that problem by listing all the players and giving them
stopwatches for both time played and time on the bench. Accessibility is important because as a coach you don't want to
drag too much equipment around. Therefore, this website is designed to be able to work  on phone, tablet, and computer.
The website is designed with a phone in mind, aimed at (beginning) coaches who will probably use phones or ipads for 
their coaching on the field.
